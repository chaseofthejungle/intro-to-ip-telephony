# Intro to IP Telephony Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) empowers users and organizations to hold low cost phone calls using the internet (hence the term 'internet telephony', which is still in use today but has widely become synonymous with 'VoIP'). Setting up a VoIP enabled phone system allows for the sending and receiving of international and local calls via a standard that has become as simple to understand in principle as mobile messaging and social media direct messaging systems.

## 1. <a name="voip">Voice over IP (VoIP): How It Works</a>

**Three common methods for implementing VoIP include:**

* *Computer-to-Computer:* Requires a (quality) sound card and software, a microphone (built-in or peripheral), and perhaps a headseat or earbuds.
* *Using an IP Telephone:* Although these resemble phone systems of the past, they are connected directly to a computer and (often) are prepared with software and hardware for connecting to a server or router. They use RJ-45 (Ethernet port) connectors.
* *Using an Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA):* These make traditional telephone to computer connections (for placing VoIP phone calls) plausible. This involves converting the phone's analog signal into digital data (for internet data transfer purposes). They rely on RJ-11 connectors.

## 8. <a name="sip">Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</a>

*Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)* defines how interfaces connect over high-speed IP networks for conducting live discussions. It provides a 'digital handshake' process for starting (initiating calls after negotiating parameters/terms of connections) and finishing conversations. In other words, SIP orchestrates video and/or audio transfer for video chats, phone calls, instant messaging systems, and even online games and conference bridges... and does so in real-time.

SIP operates as VoIP's popular signaling protocol, allowing for devices to not just connect for sessions (unique instances of communications between parties) but for sessions to be modified and ended as is appropriate. This means migrating from the traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) phone line system as a standard for business communications, in favor of utilizing more advanced and efficient IP-based communications systems. SIP features various other benefits, including high scalability, secure protocols, support for a unified communications platform (integrating video, audio, instant messaging, and other forms of communication), cost-efficiency (by relying on previously installed network infrastructure), and significant portability (allowing for switching between interfaces without disruption).

SIP is included with VoIP because it allows for call setups, call transfers, and seamless communications to happen. SIP relays VoIP data traffic over UDP or TCP, via ports 5060 and 5061.

Important RFC documents concerning SIP include [RFC 2543](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2543) (proposal) and [RFC 3261](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261) (standardization).
